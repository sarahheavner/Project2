          <h4>Overview</h4>
          <p>The World Health Organization estimates that in 2016 91% of the world population lived in areas that did not meet air quality guidelines. 
            The WHO also estimates that outdoor air pollution contributed to approximately 4.2 million premature deaths globally, with over 90% of those deaths occurring in low and middle income countries. 
            Exposure to polluted air has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease, as well as cancer.</p>
          <p>The charts below plot various air quality data and poverty rates for counties within the United States based on data from the EPA and U.S Census Bureau. 
            The purpose of the visualizations is to see if there is an obvious correlation between counties with poor air quality and poverty. 
            Interestingly, the charts do not show an obvious relationship between counties with higher poverty and poor air quality.
            It is important to remember that health is affected by many factors - lack of access to nutritious food, routine healthcare and clean water, inability to afford health insurance, and exposure to hazardous conditions at work, pre-existing or untreated health conditions- 
            all of which can contribute to a person, particularly those experiencing poverty, being more susceptible to the effects of moderate to poor air quality conditions.
            The charts are filtered by state and year for 2016 - 2019 and will update when a new state or year is selected from the dropdown menu.</p>

          <h4>Chart Descriptions</h4>
          <h6>Total AQI Days Per County</h6>
          <p>This chart visualizes the total count of days with an air pollutant present for each county.</p>
          <h6>Contaminant Breakdown Per County</h6>
          <p>This chart visualizes the count of days that each of the main contaminants were present for each county in the selected state and year against the poverty rate.
            *NOTE* Presence of an air contaminant means just that - it was present in the air.
            It does not necessarily mean that air quality conditions were unhealthy or hazardous based on the classifications from the EPA.</p>
          <h6>Count of Select AQI Classification Days Per County</h6>
          <p>This chart visualizes the count of days per county that were classified as moderate, unhealthy for sensitive people, unhealthy, very unhealthy, or hazardous against the poverty rate. 
            This chart does not specificy which contaminant was present at unhealthy or hazardous levels and does not include a count of days classified as good.
